## 🔧 Configuration

Create a `.env` file in the root directory and set the following environment variables:

```env
CLIENT_ID=your_civic_auth_client_id
SESSION_SECRET=your_secure_session_secret
```

- **CLIENT_ID**: Your CivicAuth application client ID.

## 🏃 Running the App

```bash
yarn dev
```

The server will start on `http://localhost:3000`.
