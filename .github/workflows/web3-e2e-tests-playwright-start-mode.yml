  # SKIPPED: Turbopack wallet adapter test - Civic wallet not appearing in wallet selection modal
  # Issue: The Solana Wallet Adapter auto-discovery mechanism for Civic wallet is not working with Turbopack
  # This appears to be a limitation in how the wallet adapter's discovery works with Turbopack's bundling
  # The non-wallet-adapter turbopack test (job-solana-next15-turbopack-no-wa-example-app) works correctly
